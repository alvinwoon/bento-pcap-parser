// Placeholder assembly file for SIMD optimizations
// The actual implementations are provided as C stubs for now
// In production, these would contain hand-optimized SIMD assembly

// This file is intentionally minimal to avoid symbol conflicts
// Real SIMD implementations would go here when fully integrated
// 
// Note: placeholder_simd_function is implemented in simd_optimizer.c
// to avoid duplicate symbol conflicts
